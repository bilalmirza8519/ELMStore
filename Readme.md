In order to leverage the prior knowledge of recurring concepts, previously learnt in formation should be retained in an efficient way.
With the ELM-Store technique, we manage to retain information of past concepts without occupying considerable memory space. ELM-Store 
has the unique feature of storing information with which classifiers can be trained later having: 1) Computation and memory requirements of
incremental leraners 2) Performance of batch learners
